                        <p>Seub was awarded a British Council scholarship for a master's degree at London University to study resource and environmental conservation.</p>

                        <p>Seub was appointed as wildlife evacuation project leader for the Cheow Lan Dam project, with a budget of only 800,000 baht to evacuate a 100,000-acre (400 km2) area.</p>

                        <p><strong>1987</strong></p>
                        <p>The Rajjaprabha Dam Reservoir or Cheow Lan Dam, Thailand's thirteenth, was completed in 1987. The resulting flooding destroyed 185 square kilometres of the country's largest remaining area of lowland evergreen rain forest. For the first time ever in Thailand a rescue operation was carried out to try to save some of the wildlife, which included threatened and endangered species stranded on islands as the waters rose. Over 18 months 1,364 animals of 116 species were captured. Forty-four died soon after. The survivors were released into protected areas nearby.
                        Seub was able to save hundreds of animals, but was aware that many more were unable to escape and died. After what he saw as the failure of the Cheow Lan project, he fought against further logging and dam construction projects.</p>

                    <p class="subtext">
                        In 1989, under pressure from many sides while he was working as head of the Huai Kha Khaeng Sanctuary including a worker's wage problem, disagreements with higher-ups, the death of some employees at the hands of encroachers, Seub became despondent.[7] Seub realised that the only way to fully conserve the sanctuary was to make it a UNESCO World Heritage site. He researched and completed the report to that effect then submitted it to the organisation which approved it after his death.

                        <p><strong>31 August 1990</strong></p>
                        <p>Seub worked as usual. Later that day, he started to return things he had borrowed from others and had a meal with some of his companions. One of the people present was the last person to talk to Seub before his death.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>1 September 1990</strong></p>
                        <p>at approximately 04:00, a gunshot was heard by a security guard. At Huai Kha Khaeng, the sound of gunshots was not uncommon. Seub was not seen at breakfast. At 10:00 one of his colleagues went to his shelter and found his body on his bed surrounded by pieces of paper. On one was written, "I have the intention to kill myself, no one was associated in this decision." signed by Seub.</p>

                    <p class="subtext">In midâ€“December 1991, approximately a year and a half after Seub's death, UNESCO certified Thungyai Naresuan-Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary as a World Heritage Site, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia.</p>

                        Seub's death jolted Thailand into action. Ten days after his cremation, on 10 September 1990, the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation was established. The foundation has received donations from The Queen Dowager Sirikit and Princess Soamsawal and thousands of others. Its goals are to protect natural sanctuaries and the flora and fauna inhabiting them and to protect endangered species.
